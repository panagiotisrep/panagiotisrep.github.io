#### Research Interests
 - Geometric Random Walks
 - Convex Optimization
 - Polynomial Eigenvalue Problems

Currently working on a semidefinite programming solver, via the use of randomized algorithms and geometric random walks. You can see some high level [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LlkT4pUDbmAjMSipWNjFAbQxg7SlPupI/view?usp=sharing)
about random walks and optimization. The C++ code is in this [branch](https://github.com/panagiotisrep/volume_approximation/tree/simulated-annealing-spectrahedra) of a fork of the [VolEsti package](https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation).
