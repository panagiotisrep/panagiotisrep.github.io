<h3>Project Details </h3>
Student: Panagiotis REPOUSKOS<br>
Organization: R Project for Statistical Computing<br>
Project: Sampling Methods for Convex Optimization<br>
Mentors: Vissarion Fisikopoulos, Elias Tsigaridas, Zafeirakis Zafeirakopoulos<br>

<br>

<h3>About the Project</h3>
The project is based on and adds functionality to the <a href="https://github.com/GeomScale/volume_approximation" target="_blank">volesti</a> library.

<br>

The project's goal was to examine existing and develop new techniques for using sampling methods to solve convex optimization (specifically linear and semidefinite programming). In particular, we made the following contributions:
<br><br>


<ul>
    <li>I implemented <b>two optimization algorithms</b>. The first is based on a randomized version of the cutting plane method  and the second improves convergence using simulated annealing. Both methods are based on sampling points from convex bodies, which is achieved with random walks.</li>
    <li>These two algorithms are implemented for polytopes (i.e. for <b>linear programming</b>) and for spectrahedra (i.e. for <b>semidefinite programming</b>).</li>
    <li>I have used heuristics to greatly improve their efficiency.</li>
    <li>We do recommend some settings, but the user is free to choose their own, including which random walk to use.</li>
    <li>Some random walks offer great precision, while others, for the price of accuracy, offer a significant speed-up and scale excellently to high dimensions.</li>
    <li>As a by-product, I have developed methods to <b>sample spectrahedra</b> - that is, to sample from the feasible region of a linear matrix inequality.</li>
</ul>

<br>
This work was also presented in the <a href="http://www.corelab.ntua.gr/acac19/" target="_blank">14th Athens Colloqium on Algorithms and Complexity</a>.

<h3>Example</h3>

This is the code to sample 1000 points from a circle, allowing the random walk to perform 10 steps per sample.


```r
library("volesti")
library("plotrix")

M0 = matrix(c(-1, 0, 0, -1), nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow = TRUE)
M1 = matrix(c(-1, 0, 0, 1), nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow = TRUE)
M2 = matrix(c(0, 1, 1, 0), nrow=2, ncol=2, byrow = TRUE)

LMI = list(M0, M1, M2)
S = volesti::Spectrahedron$new(LMI)

points = volesti::sample_spectrahedron(S, 1000, 10)
plot(points[1,], points[2,], xlim = c(-1.5, 1.5), ylim = c(-1.5, 1.5))
draw.circle(x=0, y=0, radius=1, border = 'red')
```

<h3>Week 1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The points in VolEsti are managed by class point.h using std::vectors. I changed the implementation to use Eigen vectors - needed some work at first but will save lot of time later and will be more efficient.</li>
    <li> I implemented the algorithm of "F. Dabbene, P. S. Shcherbakov, and B. T. Polyak. 2010. A Randomized Cutting Plane Method with Probabilistic Geometric Convergence. SIAM J. on Optimization 20, 6 (October 2010), 3185-3207. DOI=http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/080742506", for linear programs.</li>
    <li>I implemented the Phase I barrier method to get an initial feasible point.</li>
    <li>I created tests based on polytopes that could already be generated by VolEsti. Here are links to the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4vsl2ix4htkowa4/AABtVR4cX6pRGVeModlsSKHTa?dl=0"  target="_blank">outputs</a> of the tests and to a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wurmcmt29ae4wss/week1.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">pdf</a> that summarizes the results.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 2</h3>

I decided to keep data on one pdf. From now on, I will update <a  href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/65vrb3828t82ub2/Randomized%20cutting%20plane.pdf?dl=0">this one</a>.

<ul>
    <li>I tried a different random walk, the Hit & Run with coordinate directions. With this new walk and a little of smart programming, I could save lots of computations. There was an impressive speed up!</li>
    <li>I implemented a heuristic for choosing a better direction vector (implicit isotropization).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 3</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The team had a good idea! Let's try sampling a single point at each phase and cut the polytope based on that.</li>
    <li>I tried different stopping criteria for the algorithm (this was bugging me since first week). A weak criterion may cause us to lose a good solution, while a strong one may lead to excessive computations.</li>
    <li>The random walk stucks and can't escape from edges. We need some escaping steps. An idea is, to try to walk towards the center of the Chebyshev ball.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 4</h3>

<ul>
    <li>There is still work on the escape step, at which we try to move towards the Chebyshev center. Needs testing and if it works I can make it work a bit faster.</li>
    <li>Another idea for an escape step is the billiard walk. It works fine. The advantage of the work till now, is that it scales very well with the dimension of the polytope (testing it on problems, which lpsolve needs hours to solve!). Must test to see which escape step works better and when, because they appear to be a bottleneck, so I must use them rarely.</li>
        
</ul>

<h3>Week 5</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Further experimentation with the billiard walk. Tried to combinethe billiard walk with the direction produced by trying to reach the Chebyshev center.</li>
    <li>Tested to see how the algorithm performs in many dimensions (up to 1500).</li>
</ul>
