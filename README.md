<h3>First Week</h3>
This is what I managed this week:

<ul>
    <li>The points in VolEsti are managed by class point.h using std::vectors. I changed the implementation to use Eigen vectors - needed some work at first but will save lot of time later and will be more efficient.</li>
    <li> I implemented the algorithm of "F. Dabbene, P. S. Shcherbakov, and B. T. Polyak. 2010. A Randomized Cutting Plane Method with Probabilistic Geometric Convergence. SIAM J. on Optimization 20, 6 (October 2010), 3185-3207. DOI=http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/080742506", for linear programs.</li>
    <li>I created tests based on polytopes that could already be generated by VolEsti. Here are links to the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4vsl2ix4htkowa4/AABtVR4cX6pRGVeModlsSKHTa?dl=0">outputs</a> of the tests and to a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wurmcmt29ae4wss/week1.pdf?dl=0">pdf</a> that summarizes the results.</li>
</ul>
